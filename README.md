## Goals
- Experiment with advanced RAG techniques
- Develop evaluation metrics for RAG applications
- Collaborate with the community to innovate and push the boundaries of RAG applications

## Current Features
This section provides a detailed explanation of the currently supported features.

The **`.hydra_config`** directory contains all the configuration files for the application. These configurations are structured using the [Hydra configuration framework](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). This directory will be referenced for setting up the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

### Supported File Formats
This branch currently supports the following file types:

* **TextFiles**: `txt`, `md`
* **Document Files**: `pdf`, `docx`, `doc`, `pptx`
* **Audio Files**: `wav`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `ogg`, `flv`, `wma`, `aac`
* **Images**: `png:, jpeg, jpg, svg`

The content from all supported formats is first converted into **Markdown**. Any images found in the documents are replaced by captions generated by a **Vision Language Model (VLM)**. (Refer to the **Configuration** section for additional details.) The final Markdown output is then split into chunks and indexed in the [Milvus vector database](https://milvus.io/).


>[!NOTE]
> **Upcoming Support**: Future releases will expand compatibility to include additional formats such as `csv`, `odt`, `html`, and other widely used open-source document types.

### Chunking
Several chunking strategies are supported, including **`semantic`**, **`markdown`** and **`recursive`** chunking. By default, the **recursive chunker** is applied to all supported file types for its efficiency and low memory usage. This is the **recommended strategy** for most use cases. Future updates may introduce format-specific chunkers (e.g., for CSV, HTML, etc.). The recursive chunker configuration is located at: *`.hydra_config/chunker/recursive_splitter.yaml`*.

```yml
# .hydra_config/chunker/recursive_splitter.yaml
defaults:
  - base
name: recursive_splitter
chunk_size: 1000
chunk_overlap: 100
```

The **`chunk_size`** and **`chunk_overlap`** values are expressed in **tokens**, not characters. For enhanced retrieval, enable the **contextual retrieval** feature — a technique introduced by Anthropic to improve retrieval performance ([Contextual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval)). To activate it, set **`CONTEXTUAL_RETRIEVAL=true`** in your **`.env`** file. Refer to the **`Usage`** section for further instructions.

### **Indexing**
Once chunked, the document fragments are stored in the **Milvus** vector database using the `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` multilingual model—ranked among the top on the [MTEB benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). To use a different model, simply set the **`EMBEDDER_MODEL`** variable in your **`.env`** file to any Hugging Face–compatible option (e.g., `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`). For faster embedding, the model is served via an inference server (VLLM).

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Choose an embedding model that aligns with your document languages and offers a suitable context window. The default model supports both English and French.

### **Retriever & Search**

#### Search Pipeline

Our **hybrid search** pipeline combines **semantic search** with **BM25** keyword matching to deliver comprehensive results. This dual approach captures both semantically related content and documents containing specific keywords. Retrieved results are then consolidated and reordered using the [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm](https://milvus.io/docs/reranking.md) for optimal relevance ranking.

#### Retrieval Strategies

Three strategies feed into the hybrid search—available only in the **RAG pipeline** (see **OpenAI Compatible API**), not in the standalone **Semantic Search** endpoints:

* **multiQuery**: Uses an LLM to generate multiple query reformulations, merging their results for superior relevance (default and most effective based on benchmarks).
* **single**: Executes a single, straightforward retrieval query. This is the default method.
* **hyde**: Generates a hypothetical answer via LLM, then retrieves chunks similar to that synthetic response.

#### **Reranker**

Finally, retrieved documents are re-ordered by relevance using a multilingual reranking model. By default, we employ **`Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-reranker-base`** from Hugging Face.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The retriever fetches documents that are semantically similar to the query. However, **`semantic similarity doesn't always equate to relevance`**. Therefore, rerankers are crucial for reordering results and filtering out less pertinent documents, thereby reducing the likelihood of hallucinations.


#### **Reranker Configuration**
Reranking models support multiple deployment formats:

**Online Serving (In-Memory)**
* Supports **`crossencoder`** and **`colbert`** reranking types
* Set the `RERANKER_MODEL_TYPE` environment variable to match your chosen model's architecture (`crossencoder` or `colbert`)

**High-Throughput Serving**
* Deploy reranking models via [Infinity](https://github.com/michaelfeil/infinity) for enhanced performance
* Set `RERANKER_MODEL_TYPE=infinity` to enable this mode
* Both `crossencoder` and `colbert` architectures are supported through this deployment method


### RAG Type
* **SimpleRAG**: Basic implementation without chat history taken into account.
* **ChatBotRAG**: Version that maintains conversation context. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12** or higher recommended
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- pFor GPU capable machines, ensure you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed. Refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) for installation instructions.

RAGondin is designed to run in a containerized environment under Linux on x86_64 architecture. ARM processors are not supported, this is subject to change in the future.

### Installation and Configuration

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/RAGondin.git

# git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/RAGondin.git # to clone the repo with the associated submodules

cd RAGondin
git checkout main # or a given release
```

#### 2. Create uv environment and install dependencies:
>[!IMPORTANT] 
> Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed along with `uv`. For detailed installation instructions for uv, refer to the [uv official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi). You can either use `uv` or `pip` (if already available) or `curl`. Additional installation methods are outlined in the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi).

```bash
# with pip
pip install uv

# with curl
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# Create a new environment with all dependencies
cd RAGondin/
uv sync
```

#### 3. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, mirroring the structure of `.env.example`, to configure your environment.

* Define your LLM-related variables (`API_KEY`, `BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`) and VLM (Vision Language Model) settings (`VLM_API_KEY`, `VLM_BASE_URL`, `VLM_MODEL_NAME`).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The **VLM** is used for generating captions from images extracted from files, and for tasks like summarizing chat history. The same endpoint can serve as both your LLM and VLM.

* For PDF indexing, multiple loader options are available. Set your choice using the **`PDFLoader`** variable:
  * **`MarkerLoader`** and **`DoclingLoader`** are recommended for optimal performance, especially on OCR-processed PDFs. They support both GPU and CPU execution.
  * For lightweight testing on CPU, use **`PyMuPDF4LLMLoader`** or **`PyMuPDFLoader`**.
    > ⚠️ These do **not** support non-searchable PDFs or image-based content and images are not handled.


* Audio & Video Files
  - Audio and video content are transcribed using OpenAI’s **Whisper** model. Supported model sizes include: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `turbo`. For details, refer to the [OpenAI Whisper repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper).The default transcription model is set via the **`WHISPER_MODEL`** variable, which defaults to `'base'`.

Other file formats (`txt`, `docx`, `doc`, `pptx`, etc) are pre-configured.

* set `AUTH_TOKEN` to enable HTTP authentication via HTTPBearer. If not provided the endpoints will be accessible without any restrictions

```bash
# This is the minimal settings required.

# LLM
BASE_URL=

# To enable HTTP authentication via HTTPBearer for the api endpoints
AUTH_TOKEN=super-secret-token
```

* **Running on CPU**:
  For quick testing on CPU, you can reduce computational load by adjusting the following settings in the **`.env`** file:

- Set **`RERANKER_TOP_K=5`** or lower to limit the number of documents returned by the reranker. This defines how many documents are included in the LLM's context—reduce it if your LLM has a limited context window (4–5 is usually sufficient for an 8k context). You can also disable the reranker entirely with **`RERANKER_ENABLED=false`**, as it is a costly operation.

>[!WARNING]
> These adjustments may affect performance and result quality but are appropriate for lightweight testing.

* **Running on GPU**:
The default values are well-suited for GPU usage. However, you can adjust them as needed to experiment with different configurations based on your machine’s capabilities.

#### 4.Deployment: Launch the app
>[!IMPORTANT]
> Before launching the app, You might want to configure the Indexation UI (). For that, see this [document](./docs/setup_indexerui.md)

The application can be launched in either in GPU or CPU environment, depending on your device's capabilities. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Launch with GPU support (recommended for faster processing)
docker compose up --build # or 'down' # to stop it

# Launch with CPU only
docker compose --profile cpu up --build # or '--profile cpu down' to stop it
```

Once it is running, you can check everything is fine by doing:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health_check # APP_PORT=8080
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The initial launch is longer due to the installation of required dependencies. Once the application is up and running, you can access the fastapi documentation at `http://localhost:8080/docs` (8080 is the APP_PORT variable determined in your **`.env`**) to manage documents, execute searches, or interact with the RAG pipeline (see the **next section** about the api for more details). A default chat ui is also deployed using [chainlit](!https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview). This ui can be deactivate by setting this boolean variable `WITH_CHAINLIT_UI=False`. You can access to it at `http://localhost:8080/chainlit` chat with your documents with our RAG engine behind it.

>[!NOTE]
> By default, the chainlit chat ui doesn't restrict access. In order to allow chat ui authentification these variables should be added

```bash
# Chainlit UI authentication
CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET=... # has to be generated with with this command: 'uv run chainlit create-secret' but a random value works too.
CHAINLIT_USERNAME=Ragondin
CHAINLIT_PASSWORD=Ragondin2025
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Chat history is disabled by default. Chainlit includes built-in data persistence capabilities with an [out-of-the-box data layer schema](https://docs.chainlit.io/data-layers/official) to store all chat interactions: conversations, elements, user feedback, and more. To enable this functionality, follow the dedicated setup guide:

➡ [Enable Chainlit Data Persistence](./docs/chainlit_data_persistency.md)



#### 5. Distributed deployment in a Ray cluster

To scale **RAGondin** in a distributed environment using **Ray**, follow the dedicated guide:

➡ [Deploy RAGondin in a Ray cluster](docs/deploy_ray_cluster.md)

#### 6. 🧠 API Overview

This FastAPI-powered backend offers capabilities for document-based question answering (RAG), semantic search, and document indexing across multiple partitions. It exposes endpoints for interacting with a vector database and managing document ingestion, processing, and querying.

### 💬 OpenAI-Compatible Chat

OpenAI API compatibility enables seamless integration with existing tools and workflows that follow the OpenAI interface. It makes it easy to use popular UIs like **`OpenWebUI`** without the need for custom adapters.

For the following OpenAI-compatible endpoints, when using an OpenAI client, provide your `AUTH_TOKEN` as the `api_key` if authentication is enabled; otherwise, you can use any placeholder value such as `'sk-1234'`.

* **`GET /v1/models`**
This endpoint allows to list all existant **`models`**

>[!NOTE]  
> Model names follow the pattern **`ragondin-{partition_name}`**, where **`partition_name`** refers to a data partition containing specific files. These “models” aren’t standalone LLMs (like GPT-4 or Llama), but rather placeholders that tell your LLM endpoint to generate responses using only the data from the chosen partition. To query the entire vector database, use the special model name **`partition-all`**.


* **`POST /v1/chat/completions`**  
OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoint using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Accepts `model`, `messages`, `temperature`, `top_p`, etc.

* **`POST /v1/completions`**
Same for this endpoint


>[!TIP]
To test these endpoint with openai client, you can refer to the the [openai_compatibility_guide.ipynb](./utility/openai_compatibility_guide.ipynb) notebook from the [📁 utility](./utility/) folder

## Troubleshooting

### Error on dependencies installation

After running `uv sync`, if you have this error:

```
error: Distribution `ray==2.43.0 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're using CPython 3.13 (`cp313`), but `ray` (v2.43.0) only has wheels with the following Python ABI tag: `cp312`
```

This means your uv installation relies on cpython 3.13 while you are using python 3.12.

To solve it, please run:
```bash
uv venv --python=3.12
uv sync
```
